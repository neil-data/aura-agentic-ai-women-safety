# AURA – Agentic AI for Women Safety

AURA is an agentic AI–driven safety platform designed to enhance women’s safety during cab rides by proactively monitoring cab routes and real-time crowd density.

---

## 🚨 Problem
Women often face safety risks during cab rides, especially at night or in unfamiliar areas.  
Unsafe route deviations and low crowd density zones increase vulnerability, and existing solutions are mostly reactive.

---

## 💡 Solution
AURA provides a **predictive and proactive safety layer** using agentic AI.  
The system continuously analyzes cab routes and surrounding crowd density to detect potential risks early and alert the user before a situation escalates.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Smart Cab Route Monitoring – Detects unsafe route deviations in real time  
- Crowd Density Awareness – Identifies low-visibility or overcrowded areas  
- Predictive Risk Alerts – Warns users before entering high-risk zones  
- Emergency SOS Interface – One-tap emergency assistance  

---

## 🎨 Frontend Prototype
- Built using Lovable
- Interactive 3D safety and route visualization using Spline
- Focused on intuitive user experience and safety-first design

---

## 🧠 Technology Stack
- Frontend: Lovable  and  wire-framing using framer and figma.
- 3D Components: Spline  
- AI Concept: Agentic AI for route risk & crowd density analysis  
- Backend:Planned (API-based architecture)

## 📊 System Overview
User initiates a cab ride →  
Agentic AI monitors route + crowd density →  
Risk detected →  
User alerted and SOS triggered if needed.

---

## 🚀 Project Status
The frontend and backend prototypes have been developed and are working perfectly individually. 
The project demonstrates all main features, including cab route monitoring, crowd density visualization, and safety alerts. 
The next step is to connect the frontend to the backend APIs, which is planned and straightforward.


---

## 👥 Team
Project developed as part of a hackathon submission focused on women safety and AI-driven solutions.
